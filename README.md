# Todo-List

> Create a clone of [Emilia Andrzejewska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUd-_Yjjqg) to-do list UI structure

#### Objectives
- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.
- Use linters with webpack to check for linters

### Project requirements for Add and Remove TO do List
- Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- By default new tasks should have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the --  new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique(i.e. if you're deleting the first task index 1 from the list, the index of the next task(2) should set to 1)..
- All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.

### Project requirements of interactive list
- Add a new JavaScript file and import it as a module:
- it will contain methods related to the status updates (completed: true / false).
- Add event listener to the checkbox (change).
- Update items object's value for completed key upon user actions.
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use filter() method).
- Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page relo
